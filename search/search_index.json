If you are uncomfortable with the idea of installing the pedal intercepter, it is possible to operate using a workaround we call \"CCLong\" or \"Redneck ACC\", using just the Comma unit, harness, and harness box. This feature emulates a very basic ACC system by activating your cars basic cruise control and then spamming virtual presses of the + and - buttons to control speed. The system is able to handle very simple speed variations while following a lead on the highway. However, it is unable to change speed fast enough to handle slowing or stopped leads or operate below 24 mph (due to GM limitations), so you will be experiencing a small fraction of what openpilot is capable of. </p>"},{"location":"hardware/comma/","title":"Installing your Comma 3X","text":"<p>Installing a Comma unit in a Bolt closely matches the guide on Comma's website.
