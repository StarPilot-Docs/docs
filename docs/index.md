# Introduction
StarPilot is a fork of [FrogPilot](https://github.com/FrogAi/FrogPilot), which itself is a fork of [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). StarPilot runs on the Comma 3 & 3X by [comma_ai](https://comma.ai/).

**openpilot** is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW). If you are here, you likely already know what openpilot is.

**FrogPilot** is a fully open-sourced fork of openpilot with a very active and collaborative community. FrogPilot adds features and car support that are not present in stock openpilot.

**StarPilot** started as a fork to improve FrogPilot's operation on various uncooperative models of Chevy Bolt, and has now expanded to provide an improved openpilot experience on supported GM vehicles.
