# Required Hardware - Volt & Other ASCM/SDGM Cars

The Volt has a number of possible configurations. 
This page lists the recommended method per car type, and all possible methods.

There are two parts to OpenPilot control: Lateral Control (Steering) & Longitudinal Control (Gas/Brake).

ASCM & SDGM give the comma control over steering. Your car's ACC will function as normal. 

SASCM allows you to override the built in ACC and use OpenPilot Longitudinal control. 
If you have stock ACC and do not wish to use OpenPilot Long, 
you can just purchase the ASCM/SDGM portion of the suggestions.

## Recommended Config per Car Model

* 2017-2018 Chevy Volt with Factory ACC: [ASCM Harness & SASCM](#ascm-harness-sascm)
* 2019 Chevy Volt with Factory ACC: [SDGM Harness & SASCM](#sdgm-harness-sascm)
* Volts without Factory ACC: [Volts without ACC](#volts-without-acc)
* Non-Volt Car with ASCM: [ASCM Harness & SASCM](#ascm-harness-sascm)
* Non-Volt Car with SDGM: [SDGM Harness & SASCM](#sdgm-harness-sascm)

## Volts without ACC 

### Purchase List

1. [Comma 3X](../hardware/comma-3x.md)
2. Choose a harness:
    1. [OBD-II Harness](../hardware/obd-harness.md)
    2. [GM Harness/Harness box (only for Volts with stock LKAS)](../hardware/gm-harness.md)
3. Optional: [Comma Pedal](../hardware/comma-pedal.md) for the ability to start from a stop in 2018 and up Volts

Lateral (steering) control:

1. If you have stock LKAS, your volt is capable of openpilot lateral control.
2. If not, you need to [flash LKAS firmware](#flashing-volt-firmware)

Longitudinal (gas/brake) control:

1. [Flashing your Volt firmware for ACC](#flashing-volt-firmware).
**This will give you the best openpilot experience.**
1. [Redneck ACC](../faq.md#what-is-redneck-acc-aka-cc-long)
1. A potential option is the [Comma Pedal](../hardware/comma-pedal.md)
, but you will be limited to L mode regen.
This is completely untested and undeveloped in the Volt. Feel free to contribute!

### Flashing Volt Firmware

> [!CAUTION] Flashing ACC 
> Flashing ACC will remove stock CC. 
> This can be restored by re-flashing stock firmware.
