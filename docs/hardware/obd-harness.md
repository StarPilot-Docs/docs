# OBD-II Harness

{% include-markdown "./embed/see-car-guide.md" %}

There are two OBD-II harness options:

* [OBD-II Harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness?harness=OBD-II): 
Can be purchased with your Comma if buying a new one.
* [Konik OBD2C connector](https://konik.ai/shop/obd2c-connector/):
Cheaper option. Does not come with the [extra long OBD-C cable](./obd-c.md) needed to reach the Comma.
