# Required Hardware - Volt & Other ASCM/SDGM Cars

The Volt has a number of possible configurations. 
This page lists the recommended method per car type, and all possible methods.

There are two parts to OpenPilot control: Lateral Control (Steering) & Longitudinal Control (Gas/Brake).

ASCM & SDGM give the comma control over steering. Your car's ACC will function as normal. 

SASCM allows you to override the built in ACC and use OpenPilot Longitudinal control. 
If you have stock ACC and do not wish to use OpenPilot Long, 
you can just purchase the ASCM/SDGM portion of the suggestions.

## Recommended Config per Car Model

* 2017-2018 Chevy Volt with Factory ACC: [ASCM Harness & SASCM](#ascm-harness-sascm)
* 2019 Chevy Volt with Factory ACC: [SDGM Harness & SASCM](#sdgm-harness-sascm)
* Volts without Factory ACC: [Volts without ACC](#volts-without-acc)
* Non-Volt Car with ASCM: [ASCM Harness & SASCM](#ascm-harness-sascm)
* Non-Volt Car with SDGM: [SDGM Harness & SASCM](#sdgm-harness-sascm)

??? info "Comma 3 End of Life (and Continued Support)"

    On 8/26/2025 Comma announced that they are dropping support for the Comma 3 to focus on the Comma 3X. As such, if you are purchasing a new or used Comma, it's probably best to go with a 3X if possible. That being said - there are not currently any technical limitations that prevent the 3 from running the current versions of OpenPilot, as it has the same processor as the 3X. We expect to be able to support the 3 in StarPilot for the forseeable future.

## ASCM Harness & SASCM

### From comma_ai:

* [Comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x)

??? warning "Do not purchase a harness from Comma"

    Comma has changed the design of the harness box & harness they ship with the 3X, and they no longer have the RJ45 port required for pedal use. See the next section for more info.

### From [BearTechWorkshop](https://shop.beartech.ca/) (aka tinybear):

* [ASCM Harness Plus + Harness Box](https://shop.beartech.ca/products/ascm-harness?variant=44900990124213)
* [SASCM](https://shop.beartech.ca/products/sascm-for-gm-vehicles)
* Optional: [Comma Pedal](https://shop.beartech.ca/products/comma-pedal) for ability to start from a stop on 2018 or newer.

??? note "Already have a Harness Cable?"

    If you already have a Harness Cable, but your Harness Box does not have an RJ45 port, you can get your Pedal with a 2x9 or 2x13 pin Harness Box - check your specific cable to ensure you purchase the correct box.

### From your cable supplier of choice:

* Optional: If buying a Comma Pedal Only: Flat Cat5e cable, at least 10ft long

## Volts without ACC and/or LKAS

Volts interface with openpilot using either of two harnesses:

1. [OBD-II Harness](#obd-ii-harness)
2. [GM Harness/Harness box (only for Volts with stock LKAS)](#gm-harness)

Lateral (steering) control:

1. If you have stock LKAS, your volt is capable of openpilot lateral control.
2. If not, you can [flash LKAS firmware](#flashing-volt-firmware)

Longitudinal (gas/brake) control:

1. [Flashing your Volt firmware for ACC](#flashing-volt-firmware).
**This will give you the best openpilot experience.**
1. Redneck ACC augments the stock CC by hitting the +/- buttons on the steering wheel for you, 
but this is *very limited and jerky*. 
The car has a maximum rate at which it will accept CC button presses, so the accel/brake
is very limited (try it manually yourself to get a feel for it).
1. A potential option is the Comma Pedal, but you will be limited to L mode regen.
This is completely untested and undeveloped in the Volt. Feel free to contribute!

> [!CAUTION] Flashing ACC 
> Flashing ACC will remove stock CC. 
> This can be restored by re-flashing stock firmware. 

### Flashing Volt Firmware

pinballben is the resident expert on flashing Volt firmware, who will provide the instructions and hardware
for a fee. DM on discord (through the member list of the frogpilot discord).


### From comma_ai:

* [Comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x)

### OBD-II Harness

One of the following two OBD Harnesses (neither come with the OBD-C cable that is also needed):

* [OBD-II Harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness?harness=OBD-II) - Can be purchased with your Comma if buying a new one.
* [Konik OBD2C connector](https://konik.ai/shop/obd2c-connector/) - Cheaper option. Confirmed by a community member to work as an OBD harness for Volts that need it. Does not come with the extra long OBD-C cable extension needed to reach the Comma.

### GM Harness and Harness Box

The harness and harness box are required for openpilot to communicate with your car.

Purchase from tinybear: [Harness set (Harness Cable + Harness Box)](https://shop.beartech.ca/products/harness-set-gm?variant=44665970688181)

> [!WARNING] Purchasing a harness from Comma
> While you could purchase a harness from Comma, we do not recommend it as it is more 
> expensive and BearTechWorkshop's customer support is better should you run into the rare 
> occurrence of product issues.
