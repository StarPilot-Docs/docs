# Car Configuration Considerations

## Tires

* Keep your tires at the recommended ==38psi==
* Keep your car ==aligned==
* ==Don't swap wheel sizes.== Swapping tires are okay, but changing wheel sizes causes more of an issue.

## One Pedal Driving/L Mode

Starpilot with the Comma Pedal relies on one pedal driving to slow down. As such, ==you MUST have your car in One Pedal mode (for Gen2) or "L" mode (for Gen0/Gen1)==. 

## Sport Mode

Generally recommended to ==leave sport mode off==. The "Map Accel/Decel to Gears" setting will allow you to use the sport mode button to change between acceleration profiles, but Sport Mode changes the lateral response for gen2 cars, resulting in less torque.
