# Installing your Comma 3X

Installing a Comma unit in a Bolt closely matches the guide on [Comma's website](https://comma.ai/setup/comma-3x?harness=Chevrolet%2520Bolt%2520EV%25202022-23). Note that the Comma Power is not needed for the Bolt, so any mention of it can be safely ignored. The Bolt provides sufficient power through it's camera harness. 

!!! note

    If you are installing a pedal, complete the next step of the guide before closing up the camera/harness area.

## Install Video

Things have changed a lot over the years, especially with the variations between cars, so there are plans to make an updated install video at some point.

[This video from Transport Evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5pBTjR0rJ4&t=317s) is quite good and walks through the process on a 2017 Bolt. If you are not installing a pedal, you can ignore the steps involving an ethernet cable. Also - the software/fork landscape has changed greatly since 2023, so refer to the software section of this documentation for more info about that. 

!!! warning "The Stupid White Clip"

    There is a tiny white clip on the connector to the camera that you have to pull back in order to add the harness. It is a pain in the ass to deal with. Some suggestions include using an eyeglass screwdriver, or a metal credit card (that you don't care about damaging).
