# Installing your Comma 3X

When installing a Comma unit in a Bolt, follow the [Comma website's guide](https://comma.ai/setup/comma-3x?harness=Chevrolet%2520Bolt%2520EV%25202022-23), but **disregard the optional step for the Comma Power** (OBD-II power). The Bolt's camera harness provides sufficient power, fulfilling the benefits listed for Comma Power. To preserve your car's 12V battery, the Comma unit will automatically shut off after 6 hours in the off road state.

!!! note

    If you are installing a pedal, complete the next step of the guide before closing up the camera/harness area.

## Install Video

Things have changed a lot over the years, especially with the variations between cars, so there are plans to make an updated install video at some point.

[This video from Transport Evolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5pBTjR0rJ4&t=317s) is quite good and walks through the process on a 2017 Bolt. If you are not installing a pedal, you can ignore the steps involving an ethernet cable. Also - the software/fork landscape has changed greatly since 2023, so refer to the software section of this documentation for more info about that. 

!!! warning "The Stupid White Clip"

    There is a tiny white clip on the connector to the camera that you have to pull back in order to add the harness. It is a pain in the ass to deal with. Some suggestions include using an eyeglass screwdriver, or a metal credit card (that you don't care about damaging).
