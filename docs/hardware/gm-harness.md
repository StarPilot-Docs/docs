> [!WARNING] Purchasing a harness from Comma
> While you could purchase a harness from Comma, we do not recommend it as it is more 
> expensive and BearTechWorkshop's customer support is better should you run into the rare 
> occurrence of product issues.
>
> If you need a pedal (or potentially want one in the future), 
> do not purchase the harness box from Comma 
> as it no longer has the RJ45 port needed by the Comma Pedal.
