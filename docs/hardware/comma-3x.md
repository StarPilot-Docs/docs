> [!NOTE] Comma 3 End of Life (and Continued Support)
> On 8/26/2025 Comma announced that they are dropping support for the Comma 3 to focus on 
> the Comma 3X. As such, if you are purchasing a new or used Comma, it's probably best to 
> go with a 3X if possible. That being said - there are not currently any technical 
> limitations that prevent the 3 from running the current versions of OpenPilot, as it has 
> the same processor as the 3X. We expect to be able to support the 3 in StarPilot for the 
> foreseeable future.
