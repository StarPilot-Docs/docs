# Driving Model

The driving model is the core perception and planning system behind openpilot. 
It processes video and outputs the desired steering and acceleration/braking.

Model preferences are personal; 
they can vary based upon vehicle, region, environment, and preferences.
This page is a guide; try a few models and search for feedback in the Discord.
