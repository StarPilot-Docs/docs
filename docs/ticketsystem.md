# Ticket System

StarPilot thrives on the feedback and responsiveness of our community. If you are experiencing an issue, please open a ticket and share what you are seeing. The more people submitting feedback, the better your car (and everyone else's) can drive.

## What is it?

The Discord ticket system is the main way to report problems and request support for StarPilot. Create a ticket if your car meets Comma's requirements but is not yet supported by StarPilot, if you experience ping-ponging or steering wobble, or if you encounter another issue that requires investigation. For basic configuration questions, ask in the appropriate public support channel instead. Firestar will review your ticket when available and may release an update to address the issue.

## Before creating a ticket!

You must first be a member of the [StarPilot Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/b8EzGp5RtE).

Potential fixes are first released on the Dom branch. If you are using the Starpilot branch, you will need to [switch to Dom](#how-do-i-switch-from-the-starpilot-branch-to-dom) to test the update.

## How do I create a ticket?

1. Open the StarPilot Discord.
2. Go to the [#submit-feedback-and-reports](https://discord.com/channels/1387432184121393333/1506463404863389806) channel.
3. Select the appropriate report button.

4. Get your [route information and upload your logs](./faq.md#how-do-i-upload-logs-for-troubleshooting). Add that information to the form, describe the problem or requested feature in as much detail as possible, and select Submit.

## How do I switch from the Starpilot branch to Dom?

You can switch branches through your Comma device or the Galaxy dashboard. You do not need to reinstall StarPilot.

### Through your Comma device

1. Open the device settings.
2. Go to Software.
3. Change Target Branch to Dom.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Through Galaxy

1. Log in to your Galaxy dashboard.
2. Open the navigation bar.
3. Go to Software.
4. Find Branch Switching and change the branch to Dom.
5. At the bottom of the page, select Switch + Update.

> [!Important]
> Your vehicle must be parked and your Comma device must be in offroad mode before you can switch branches.

> [!Tip]
> If you do not want to remain on Dom, wait until the fix is included in the next StarPilot release. You can then follow the same process to switch back to the Starpilot branch.
